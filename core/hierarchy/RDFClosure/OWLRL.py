"""
This module is a C{brute force} implementation of the OWL 2 RL profile.

RDFLib works with 'generalized' RDF, meaning that triples with a BNode predicate are I{allowed}. This is good because, eg, some of the
triples generated for RDF from an OWL 2 functional syntax might look like '[ owl:inverseOf p]', and the RL rules would then operate
on such generalized triple. However, as a last, post processing steps, these triples are removed from the graph before serialization
to produce 'standard' RDF (which is o.k. for RL, too, because the consequent triples are all right, generalized triples might
have had a role in the deduction steps only).
