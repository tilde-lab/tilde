"""
The combined closure: performing I{both} the OWL 2 RL and RDFS closures.
The two are very close but there are some rules in RDFS that are not in OWL 2 RL (eg, the axiomatic
triples concerning the container membership properties). Using this closure class the
OWL 2 RL implementation becomes a full extension of RDFS.
